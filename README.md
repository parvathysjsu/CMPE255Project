In this project, we investigate the following:

1. The trend of wildfires - Have they increased or decreased over the years. 
2. Main causes of the fire.
3. Geospatial visualization of the data.

The trend of wildfires - Have they increased or decreased over the years.
Given the geographical details of an area, predict if wildfires are likely to occur
