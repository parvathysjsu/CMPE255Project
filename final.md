## Abstract
Wildfire is the most common form of a natural disaster. It is an unplanned and unwanted fire in areas with
combustible vegetation. Wildfires wreaked havoc in many states of the USA in the year 2020.
In this year alone, more than 8 million acres had been burnt. Wildfires affect forest cover, wildlife,
human habitat, and adversely influence climatic changes. A NICC report states that
on average, around 2500 homes are destroyed or impacted every year due to wildfires. Therefore, it
is essential to adopt measures to tackle this situation. Early detection or prediction
can promote early response, thereby minimizing the adversities caused by the fire. Through this project, we propose
a model to predict the occurrence of wildfire given the temperature and precipitation details of the region. 


## Experiments/Analysis
The experimentation involved preprocessing analysing the wildfire and temperature datasets, merging the two datasets and 
classifying the occurrence.

### Preprocessing wildfire dataset
The wildfire dataset consisted of a spreedsheet, which included the start and end date of the fire, cause, firename
etc and a geospatial shapefile which included the geographical points of the shape of the corresponding wildfire. To
use these data to analyze and predict the occurrence of wildfire the following preprocessing steps were performed -
